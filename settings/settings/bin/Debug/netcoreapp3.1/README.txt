I. Introduction
Welcome!
This is a skin made for the VSRG, soundsphere (github.com/semyon422/soundsphere).
It is inspired by the PORTABLE 1 gear CLASSIC note skin from DJMAX Respect V.
In this readme, we will be explaining how to use it.



II. Setting the skin up
1. Put this folder in soundsphere\userdata\skins.
2. Go to DJMAX\settings\customscores and choose a custom score* of your liking.
"with early and late" means that it will show MIN if you hit too early.
DJMAX does not have this feature, so it is not the default.
3. Override CustomScore.lua in soundsphere\sphere\screen\gameplay 
with your chosen custom score. Make sure you rename it to CustomScore.lua.
4. Override soundsphere\sphere\screen\result\JudgeTable.lua* with 
DJMAX\settings\JudgeTable.lua
5. Start up soundsphere and select one of the keymodes this skin offers.

custom score*:
The grade you see after hitting a note.
In DJMAX this is displayed as MAX100% - MAX1% but you may also know it as
Great - Bad.

judge table*:
CEYNOU HELP



III. Customizing the skin
The settings.exe in the folder gives you the option to turn certain visuals 
on or off. You might have to install .NET Core before being able to use it.
.NET Core is a very popular framework from micorsoft that you will likely
need in the near future anyways.

You can also change the images used by the skin by overriding them with your own images.

Most files can be moved arround and put into different sub folders as long as
they are not put outside the DJMAX folder.
Exceptions for this are: settings.exe, log.txt and metadata.json.
After restructuring the files, you will need to press Apply in the settings.exe.

The name of the folder represents the name of the skin.
If you change the folder name and press Apply in the settings.exe, it should
change the name of the skin inside soundsphere.



IV. End note
You should know enough to start using the skin now.
If you run into any trouble or find a bug, you can contact us via discord.
Thank you for using our skin and have a good time playing!
